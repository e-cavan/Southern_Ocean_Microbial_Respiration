# Southern_Ocean_Microbial_Respiration
All the data and R code needed to reproduce the plots and statistical analysis from the main manuscript of Cavan & Boyd 2018 in review in Aquatic Microbial Ecology.


4 data files are included (.csv). 2 are to estimate POC turnover within the vials (...O2_rates.csv and ...POC_vials.csv) and 2 to make the depth profile (...POC_depth.csv and ...CTD.csv). 

To plot the satellite chlorophyll map the raw netcdf file needs to be downloaded from NASA Ocean Colour. Details in the .R file. A processed data file for the satellite chl data is also given (...MODISA_chl_old.csv).
